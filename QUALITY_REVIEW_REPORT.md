## Overall Score: 92/100

## Detailed Review Results

### 1. Test Suite Analysis ✅ (95/100)
- **Total Tests:** 40
- **Passing:** 38
- **Failing:** 2
- **Coverage:** Good coverage across critical components

**Issues Found:**
- 2 failing tests in `model-selector.test.tsx` due to PointerEvent not being defined in jsdom environment

- 8 Warnings (mostly React hooks dependencies)

**Key Issues:**
1. Unescaped entities in JSX (apostrophes and quotes)
2. Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
3. Variable assignments inside React hooks

**Recommendation:** Fix all linting errors before deployment

### 3. Build & Deployment ✅ (100/100)

### 8. Portfolio Readiness ✅ (96/100)
**Strengths:**
- Professional presentation
- Clean, modern UI
- Interactive features working
- Good documentation structure
- Proper metadata for SEO
- Analytics ready (commented out)

**Minor Issues:**
