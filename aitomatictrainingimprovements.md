AiTomatic Development Roadmap
Transforming AiTomatic from a prototype into the world's most powerful personalized AI system

Core Vision
AiTomatic will become the definitive platform for creating personalized AI agents that adapt to individual users and their specific needs. Unlike traditional AI interfaces that require constant prompting, AiTomatic models remember context, blend multiple API capabilities, and truly understand the human they're designed to assist.

By combining a powerful model builder with seamless API integration, AiTomatic will enable anyone to create their own AI assistant tailored to their exact requirements - whether for personal productivity, creative work, specialized knowledge tasks, or assistive technologies.
